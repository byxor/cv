# cv

Here are some tools I use to automatically generate and maintain my CV.

## Steps Involved

Python -> LaTeX -> PDF

* My [CV content](https://github.com/byxor/cv/blob/master/cv/content.py) is written in Python.
* It gets [formatted](https://github.com/byxor/cv/blob/master/cv/formatting.py) into a [LaTeX document](https://github.com/byxor/cv/blob/master/cv.tex).
* It gets converted into a [PDF document](https://github.com/byxor/cv/blob/master/cv.pdf).
